Since a factoring problem can be turned into a period finding problem in polynomial time, an efficient period finding algorithm can be used to factor integers efficiently too. For now its enough to show that if we can compute the period of $a^x\\bmod N$ efficiently, then we can also efficiently factor. Since period finding is a worthy problem in its own right, we will first solve this, then discuss how this can be used to factor in section 5."
