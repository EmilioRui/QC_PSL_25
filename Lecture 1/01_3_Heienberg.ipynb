    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably heard of the uncertainty principle, even outside of your physics courses. A common colloquial restatement of uncertainty is \"By looking at something, you influence it.\" That is certainly true. But a more physical way of describing uncertainty is that there are certain physical observables that have an incompatibility that prevents them both from being simultaneously known to arbitrary accuracy. Many students first encounter the pair of incompatible variables $x$ and $p_x$, meaning the position along one axis called the $x$-axis, and the linear momentum along that direction, respectively. For those variables the constraint on uncertainty is written\n",
    "$$\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.$$\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta x$ is called the \"uncertainty in $x$\", which has the same definition as standard deviation in statistics, and can be defined as\n",
    "$$\\Delta x = \\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2}.$$\n",
    "$\\Delta p_x$ is defined in the same way.\n",
    "Here, we will not derive this uncertainty relation; we will point out that it is consistent with our understanding of classical waves. That is, a wave with truly one perfect frequency $f$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ would go on and on forever as a perfect sinusoid. Quantum mechanically, this would correspond to knowing the momentum perfectly according to de Broglie's hypothesis: $\\lambda = h/p$. But in order to know $where$ a wave-like particle is located, the wave describing it must become more sharply peaked in space, like a very narrow Gaussian, for example. We know that we can express any continuous function, including such sharply-peaked wave functions, as a Fourier series of sinusoidal functions with different wavelengths. But as the wave function becomes more sharply peaked (and the position is better known), we will require more terms in the Fourier series, meaning a mixture of more wavelengths (and thus, quantum mechanically, more values of momentum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stated more simply: a state with a well-defined momentum (a perfect sinusoid in space) has very uncertain position. A state with a well-defined position (like a Dirac delta distribution) has a very uncertain momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other variables that exhibit such incompatibility. For example, a particle's spin may have a well-defined projection along one axis, but then we know nothing about the project on an orthogonal axis. For example the state $|0\\rangle \\sim |\\uparrow\\rangle$ (for a qubit or spin-1/2 particle) has a definite projection along the $z$ axis (of 1 in the context of a qubit, and of $\\hbar/2$ in the context of a spin-1/2 particle). But this state can be written as a superposition of two states each of which has a well-defined projection onto the $x$ axis:\n",
    "$$|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_x+|-\\rangle_x)$$\n",
    "or equivalently\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix}\\right].$$\n",
    "$|+\\rangle_x$ has a well-defined projection onto $x$, as does $|-\\rangle_x$. So if we specify the projection of a state along the $x$ axis, we do not know the projection along the $z$ axis. And if we specify the projection on the $z$ axis, we don't know the projection along $x$. There are minor differences when discussing this in the context of spin and in qubits. But generally speaking, eigenstates of the Pauli matrices have an interesting relationship that we can explore.\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, we will be experimentally checking our intuition for the uncertainty in these incompatible variables, and verifying that uncertainty relations hold on IBM quantum computers."
