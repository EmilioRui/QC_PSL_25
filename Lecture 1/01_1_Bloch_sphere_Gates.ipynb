All the complex variables, objects and data structures used in modern software are basically all just big piles of bits. Those of us who work on quantum computing call these *classical variables.* The computers that use them, like the one you are using to read this article, we call *classical computers*.\n",

These have exactly the same restrictions as normal bits do: they can store only a single binary piece of information, and can only ever give us an output of `0` or `1`. However, they can also be manipulated in ways that can only be described by quantum mechanics. This gives us new gates to play with, allowing us to find new ways to design algorithms.\n",

    "Classical bits always have a completely well-defined state: they are either `0` or `1` at every point during a computation. There is no more detail we can add to the state of a bit than this. So to write down the state of a of classical bit (`c`), we can just use these two binary values. For example:\n",

    "    c = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction is lifted for quantum bits. Whether we get a `0` or a `1` from a qubit only needs to be well-defined when a measurement is made to extract an output. At that point, it must commit to one of these two options. At all other times, its state will be something more complex than can be captured by a simple binary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how to describe these, we can first focus on the two simplest cases. As we saw in the last section, it is possible to prepare a qubit in a state for which it definitely gives the outcome `0` when measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a name for this state. Let's be unimaginative and call it $0$ . Similarly, there exists a qubit state that is certain to output a `1`. We'll call this $1$. These two states are completely mutually exclusive. Either the qubit definitely outputs a ```0```, or it definitely outputs a ```1```. There is no overlap. One way to represent this with mathematics is to use two orthogonal vectors.\n",

This helps us distinguish them from things like the bit values ```0``` and ```1``` or the numbers 0 and 1. It is part of the bra-ket notation, introduced by Dirac.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with vectors, you can essentially just think of them as lists of numbers which we manipulate using certain rules. If you are familiar with vectors from your high school physics classes, you'll know that these rules make vectors well-suited for describing quantities with a magnitude and a direction. For example, the velocity of an object is described perfectly with a vector. However, the way we use vectors for quantum states is slightly different to this, so don't hold on too hard to your previous intuition. It's time to do something new!\n",

For example, were we to constantly measure each of our qubits to keep track of their value at each point in a computation, they would always simply be in a well-defined state of either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. As such, they would be no different from classical bits and our computation could be easily replaced by a classical computation. To achieve truly quantum computation we must allow the qubits to explore more complex states. Measurements are therefore only used when we need to extract an output. This means that we often place all the measurements at the end of our quantum circuit. \n",
